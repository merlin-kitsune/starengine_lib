# Changelog (English)

> This file contains the English changelog only. Chinese version: [`CHANGELOG_ZH.md`](CHANGELOG_ZH.md).
> The two files correspond one-to-one by version number: each version appears once in both files, and every change must update both together — never only one side.

## 1.0.2

> Version note: this release **skips `1.0.1`** — that number was never pushed and never published
> (its two batches of changes were each merged into `1.0.0`), yet the local mavenLocal still holds a
> 2026-09-22 `1.0.1` directory left over from the withdrawn version. Reusing that number would be an
> in-place overwrite, and consumers could silently resolve to the stale jar (corrected only by
> `--refresh-dependencies`), so this change ships as `1.0.2`.

### New features

- **`combat/HostileTargets` gains an "extra hostile" injection seam** (`ExtraHostileProbe` /
  `installExtraHostileProbe`): a consumer can install a predicate declaring which entities should
  additionally count as hostile targets, so entities that are **neither `Enemy` nor an angered
  neutral mob** (typically third-party training dummies) are correctly recognised by effects that
  require a hostile target.
  - The criterion becomes `Enemy ∪ angered NeutralMob ∪ entities declared by the consumer`; the
    two-argument overload `isHostile(viewer, target)` inherits the extension through its existing
    delegation.
  - Why a seam instead of a hard-coded rule: this criterion is called not only by consumer gameplay
    code but also by the **library's own** `target/SelectorTargets` for selectable-target checks
    (client raycast / client radius highlight / server-side confirmation) — the decision point lives
    inside the library, where a consumer cannot reach; and "which third-party entity counts as
    hostile" is consumer gameplay policy that the library must not know about. The pattern mirrors
    the existing `combat/InternalDamageWindows`.
  - **With nothing installed the previous semantics are preserved verbatim** (no entity is
    additionally treated as hostile) — the safe direction: a missing injection only falls back to the
    existing behaviour and can never turn a neutral mob hostile by accident.

### Compatibility

- **Purely additive**: a new nested type `ExtraHostileProbe`, a new static method
  `installExtraHostileProbe`, and one extra probe call at the end of the existing `isHostile(Entity)`.
  No existing public API is removed, renamed or re-signatured, and behaviour with no injection is
  unchanged ⇒ compliant with the `1.x` compatibility contract. The lower bound of the consumer's
  `starengine_lib_version_range` moves to `[1.0.2,2.0)` with this release.

## 1.0.0

> Convention: follow-up changes to entries already recorded for the current version are merged into the original entry;
> only the final wording is kept.
> Version note: `1.0.0` is the library's **first stable release** — the version number was normalised from the snapshot
> series' last notch (`1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.16`) with **zero Java source changes**; the artefact files are now
> `starengine_lib-<platform>-1.0.0.jar`. `.16` was the **26.1.2 consumer-adoption** notch — the version simply advanced
> alongside the consumer's "26.1.2 full port" (the library's convention is one notch per substantive commit).
> Note (2026-09-22): the Forge-side Curios-prerequisite removal was briefly prepared as `1.0.1`; it is **folded
> into this version** instead (see "Dependencies and metadata" below). `1.0.1` was never pushed or released.
> The snapshot series ends here; from `1.x` on, the compatibility policy below governs.
> Note (2026-09-23): the 26.1.2-side "missing platform implementation" was likewise briefly prepared as
> `1.0.1`; it is **folded into this version** instead (see "Missing platform implementation on the third
> line" below). `1.0.1` was never pushed or released.

### Missing platform implementation on the third line (merged into `1.0.0`, 2026-09-23)

- **`NeoForgeEconomyStorage` for the `neoforge-26.1.2` line** — the platform storage implementation of the wallet
  ledger. The first stable release shipped this class only on `forge-1.20.1` (`ForgeEconomyStorage`) and
  `neoforge-1.21.1` (`NeoForgeEconomyStorage`), so on `26.1.2` `StarEngineEconomy.isAvailable()` stayed `false`:
  the `/starcoin` command was never registered, picked-up star coins were not absorbed into the wallet and the
  balance bar always read 0. The 26.1.2 entry point (`StarEngineLib`) now injects the implementation, exactly like
  the other two lines.
  - Data layout, key names, `PlayerEvent.Clone` carry-over and offline `.dat` parsing are **identical** to the
    1.21.1 implementation (`NeoForgeData` persistent-data root, `starengine_lib/star_coin_wallet`, `balance`/`name`).
  - Only two 26.1.2 platform API changes had to be absorbed, both documented inline: `CompoundTag` value / sub-tag
    accessors are now `Optional` / `*Or` flavoured (no `contains(String,int)`, no bare `getCompound(String)`), and
    command permission became a **named permission set** (`CommandSourceStack#hasPermission(int)` is gone) — the
    seam's numeric level is mapped onto `Permissions.COMMANDS_MODERATOR/GAMEMASTER/ADMIN/OWNER`, so level ≥ 2 still
    means "may use `/starcoin`" exactly as on the other two lines.

### Dependencies and metadata (merged into `1.0.0`, 2026-09-22)

> This change was originally prepared as a separate `1.0.1` release. Before it was ever pushed or published the user
> decided to **fold it into `1.0.0`** — one unreleased change must not occupy two version numbers. `1.0.1` therefore
> **never existed**: there is no such tag, no such Release and no such artefact. The existing `1.0.0` tag keeps its
> name, and its Release assets are refreshed by the same CI run that builds this commit (the workflow reuses an
> existing tag and re-uploads the jars with `--clobber`).

- **The Curios prerequisite is removed on the `forge-1.20.1` side** (user decision, 2026-09-22:
  "make it consistent with the other two versions"):
  - `forge-1.20.1/src/main/templates/META-INF/mods.toml` drops the `modId="curios"` dependency block
    (previously `mandatory=true versionRange="[5,6)" ordering="AFTER" side="BOTH"`);
  - in `forge-1.20.1/build.gradle` the dependency is downgraded from `modImplementation` to **`modCompileOnly`**.
    A `mod*` configuration (not plain `compileOnly`) is required: MDG LegacyForge only routes `mod*`
    configurations through `RemappingTransform` (Mojmap/Parchment); otherwise `CuriosCompat`'s
    `LivingEntity` parameter would not match Curios' method descriptor at compile time.
  - Rationale: the library **never calls** `item/CuriosCompat` — it is a shim for consumers, and no code path
    inside the library loads it, so Curios is a **compile-time** dependency on this side only.
    **A consumer that calls that shim declares Curios itself** (`astral_dice`'s 1.20.1 side already declares
    `mandatory=true [5,6)`).
  - ⇒ **None of the three platform jars declares Curios as a prerequisite any more** (the two NeoForge lines
    never did), so the dependency blocks are now uniform across all three.
- This change is a **pure relaxation**: no public type, method, field or constant is deleted or renamed, and no
  visibility, signature or semantics changes. It therefore complies with the compatibility policy below, and the
  consumer's `starengine_lib_version_range=[1.0.0,2.0)` **needs no tightening** — no consumer code changes either.
  The only cost: if a consumer forgets to declare Curios yet calls the shim, the failure degrades from a clear
  loader-level "missing required dependency" error to a runtime `NoClassDefFoundError`.
- The three platforms always share one version number ⇒ artefact file names stay
  `starengine_lib-<platform>-1.0.0.jar` — **no `1.0.1` artefact is produced**.

### Engineering (merged into `1.0.0`)

- Verified: three-platform `./gradlew build publishToMavenLocal`; `~/.m2` holds `1.0.0` for all three coordinates
  (the short-lived aborted-release `1.0.1` coordinates were moved out of the local repository); each platform's
  `pushToPack` pushed its `1.0.0` jar into the corresponding modpack's `mods` folder (**exactly one library jar per
  pack**, so there is no duplicate-`modId` clash).
- Jar inspection: the `mods.toml` dependency block on all three platforms is now just "loader + minecraft"
  (1.21.1 = `neoforge [21.1,21.2)`; 1.20.1 = `forge [47.4.10,48)`; 26.1.2 = `neoforge [26.1.0.0,26.2)`),
  with no `modId="curios"` left.
- **Regression criterion (the important one)**: `forge-1.20.1`'s `CuriosCompat.class` is **byte-identical** to the
  one in the previous `1.0.0` build (3352 B, md5 prefix `d56a57b0`), and **not a single byte differs across all 55
  classes** ⇒ switching to `modCompileOnly` did not change reobf/remapping behaviour; this really is a
  metadata-only change.

### Compatibility policy (new, in force from 1.0.0)

- **Within one major version (first number unchanged — currently `1.x`) breaking changes are forbidden.** The library
  must not delete or rename any public type, method, field or constant, and must not change its visibility, signature
  or established semantics. Only **additions** (new types, new members, new optional entry points) and behaviour fixes
  that preserve the contract are allowed.
- **A breaking change must bump the first number (`1.x` → `2.x`)**, and must tighten the consumers'
  `starengine_lib_version_range` lower bound in the same release. Breaking changes must never hide in a minor/patch slot.
- ⇒ The consumer range `[1.0.0,2.0)` is the machine-readable form of this contract: any `1.x` release can replace
  another in place, without touching consumer code.
- This **supersedes** the earlier `gradle.properties` note that "the SNAPSHOT series' API carries no
  semantic-compatibility promise" — that exemption covered the snapshot series only, and no longer applies from
  `1.0.0` on.

### Engineering

- All three platform versions normalised from `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.16` to **`1.0.0`** and published to `mavenLocal`
  (`./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`); the three jars are
  `starengine_lib-{neoforge-1.21.1,forge-1.20.1,neoforge-26.1.2}-1.0.0.jar`.
- The consumer `astral_dice`'s **26.1.2 line** adopts this release (the `.16` code) for the first time: that line was pinned to `.11`
  and still carried local copies of `combat/HostileTargets`, `combat/PlayerHostilityTracker`, `target/SelectorTargets`
  and `target/SignSelectionGate` — all four superseded by the `.15` sinking but never synchronised during the freeze.
  They are removed by this port, their references now point at `com.merlinkitsune.starenginelib.*`, and the platform
  hook `combat/PlayerHostilityTrackerEvents` plus the `InternalDamageWindows.install(...)` injection are added
  (structurally identical to the 1.21.1 / 1.20.1 lines).
- **Zero Java source changes in the library.** Publishing a new version number is required for the usual reason: the
  version does not end in `-SNAPSHOT` (a plain version per Maven semantics), so Gradle does not treat it as a changing
  module — without a bump the consumer would keep resolving the stale jar from `mavenLocal`.

## Unreleased (1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.15)

> Convention: follow-up changes to entries already recorded for the current version are merged into the original entry;
> only the final wording is kept.
> Version note: `.15` is the **shared-judgement sinking** release — it moves the byte-identical hostility / selector /
> wallet-display judgements out of the consumer `astral_dice` and into the library.

### New features

- **New `combat` package: the single entry point for hostile-target judgement, sunk from the consumer.**
  `HostileTargets` (`isHostile(Entity)` / `isHostile(viewer, target)`; semantics = hostile mobs ∪ angered neutral mobs ∪
  "players neither on the same team nor who have ever attacked the viewer") and `PlayerHostilityTracker`
  (an in-memory map of victim UUID → attacker UUIDs, with `hasAttacked` / `forget`).
  ⚠️ **Table and events are separated**: the library **registers no events at all** (a library red line), so the four
  platform hooks stay on the consumer side — record an attack (`LivingDamageEvent`), clear on death
  (`LivingDeathEvent`), clear on death-respawn clone (`PlayerEvent.Clone`) and clear on log-out
  (`PlayerLoggedOutEvent`) are translated by the consumer's `combat.PlayerHostilityTrackerEvents` into the library's
  `recordAttack` / `recordAttackIfExternal` / `forget` calls.
- **New platform seam `InternalDamageWindows`**: `PlayerHostilityTracker` must distinguish a "deliberate attack" from the
  mod's own splash / AOE / counter-injection damage. Those two window flags belong to the consumer's gameplay
  implementation (not sunk), so the library only exposes the predicate and the consumer injects it at startup via
  `install(aoeProbe, counterProbe)`. When nothing is installed both predicates return `false` — the safe direction,
  since a missed match only records one extra hostility entry while a false match would drop a real attack.
- **New `target.SelectorTargets`**: routes the "hostile" families through `HostileTargets`, fixing the defect where
  `TargetType#matches` tests `ENEMY` / `ENEMY_OR_RIVAL` with a bare `instanceof Enemy` and therefore misses angered
  wolves / iron golems / polar bears / bees. It also carries the four-argument overload that permits self-targeting.
  The defect is **adapted around in place rather than rewriting `TargetType`**, so the existing semantics stay
  byte-for-byte identical and all call sites go through `SelectorTargets`.
- **New `target.SignSelectionGate`**: the pending record for sign active-skill pre-gating (pure in-memory and
  transient: `arm` / `isArmed` / `take` / `clear`).
- **New `economy.StarCoinWalletState`**: the client-side display cache behind the star coin wallet balance bar
  (primitives only, **deliberately free of any client-only type** so the dedicated server can load it too).
  It shares a domain with the library's existing `StarEngineEconomy`.

### Engineering

- All three platforms bumped `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.14 → 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.15` and were `publishToMavenLocal`'d; `compileJava`
  passes on all three (including the shared source compiling against **26.1.2**, which is exactly what enforces the
  "only APIs present in all three MC versions" red line). Jar inspection confirms all seven new classes are present on
  every platform (including `InternalDamageWindows$Probe` and `SignSelectionGate$Pending`).
- The consumer `astral_dice` dropped its local copies on both sides: `combat/HostileTargets`,
  `combat/PlayerHostilityTracker`, `target/SelectorTargets`, `target/SignSelectionGate` and
  `economy/StarCoinWalletState` were removed, and `combat/PlayerHostilityTrackerEvents` was added as the platform hook.

## Unreleased (1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.14)

> Convention: follow-up changes to entries already recorded for the current version are merged into the original entry;
> only the final wording is kept.
> Version note: `.14` adds the **player balance ledger backend** (the library side of the star coin wallet feature).

### New features

- **New player balance ledger (library-side backend of the star coin wallet)**: a new `economy` package in `common` —
  `EconomyStorage` (the platform storage seam: read / write / offline read), `StarEngineEconomy` (the public API:
  `getBalance / setBalance / hasBalance / deposit / withdraw / transfer` plus offline reads; **returns 0 / false and never
  throws when no storage is installed**, so third-party mods such as FTB can integrate safely) and `StarCoinCommand`
  (`/starcoin add|set|remove|get|rank`, where `rank` includes **offline players**).
  The balance lives in **player persistent NBT** — the library's standing invariant is that it never registers registry
  entries, so `AttachmentType` is deliberately not used — and is explicitly copied on `PlayerEvent.Clone`, so the
  **balance survives death**. One implementation per platform (`NeoForgeEconomyStorage` / `ForgeEconomyStorage`; the only
  differences are the event package names and the persistent-data root segment in the player `.dat`, i.e.
  `NeoForgeData` / `ForgeData`); 26.1.2 is **not wired up** (the API degrades to unavailable). The platform entry point
  installs the storage implementation.
- **New command permission seam `CommandPermissionGate`**: `CommandSourceStack#hasPermission(int)` has a different
  signature on **26.1.2** (identical on 1.20.1 / 1.21.1), so shared code does not write the permission predicate directly;
  the platform supplies `(source, level) -> source.hasPermission(level)`.

### Engineering

- Version bumped on all three platforms from `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.13` to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.14` and published with
  `publishToMavenLocal`; `build` passes on all three (including compiling the shared sources on 26.1.2, which is exactly
  what enforces the keep-common-version-agnostic rule).

## 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.13

> Convention: later edits to an entry already recorded for this version are merged into that entry — only the final version is kept, no "updated again" follow-ups.
> Note on the version number: `.13` is the **resource-pack metadata fix + version-line unification** release — it adds the missing `pack.mcmeta` to `forge-1.20.1` (Forge validates every mod jar as a resource pack; without that file the loading screen shows a warning and the mod's resource pack is **not registered**) and keeps the `.6` loader-gate fix. Per the user's ruling of 2026-09-17 the library version is unified as `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.10` (same patch segment as the consumer's `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.10`); the fix was originally in flight as `.7` (published to `mavenLocal` only, never committed), so it is merged into this section per the convention above and no separate `.7` section is created. The bump is mandatory for the same reason as before: the version does not end in `-SNAPSHOT` (a normal version under Maven semantics), so Gradle does not treat it as a changing module — without a bump a consumer keeps resolving the old jar from `mavenLocal`, which has no `pack.mcmeta` (and needs `--refresh-dependencies` to be re-resolved anyway).

- **New mod icon plus a description synced across all three platforms.** The repository-root `icon.png` is now shipped as each jar's mod icon: the same bytes (2671 bytes, PNG signature `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`) were copied to `neoforge-1.21.1/src/main/resources/icon.png`, `forge-1.20.1/src/main/resources/icon.png` and `neoforge-26.1.2/src/main/resources/icon.png` — the **jar root**, which is where FML resolves `logoFile` from (same mechanism the consumer `astral_dice` jars use for their own root-level `icon.png`). All three metadata templates gained the logo key, and their `description` was replaced with the 1.21.1-side text: `A common library for the Astral Dice mod. It includes cross-platform implementations and supports functional integration with other mods.` The former Chinese multi-paragraph description is therefore gone from `forge-1.20.1` and `neoforge-26.1.2` too, so the mod-list entry is now identical on all three platforms. Note: the repository-root `icon.png` is not a resource root of any subproject — the three copies under `src/main/resources` are the shipped ones. This is a metadata/resource-only change; **no Java source changed**. Version bumped `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.12 → 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.13` on all three platforms for the usual reason: the number does not end in `-SNAPSHOT` (a normal version under Maven semantics), so Gradle does not treat it as a changing module — without a bump a consumer keeps resolving the old `mavenLocal` jar, which has no icon and still carries the old description.
  - ⚠️ **Correction (2026-09-22): the key was originally spelled `logofile` (lowercase `f`) and therefore never took effect.** TOML keys are case-sensitive and the documented key is `logoFile` (capital `F`), so the unrecognized `logofile` key was **silently ignored by the metadata parser and no logo was ever loaded** — the icon file itself was shipped correctly all along (present at the jar root, valid 64×64 RGBA PNG, 2-to-the-power-of-2, bytes identical to the repository root), so the failure was purely the key's casing. Fixed on all three platforms as `logoFile="icon.png"` (verified by opening the built jars: the `.14` jars carry `logoFile="icon.png"` and an `icon.png` whose md5 equals the repository root's `09762024a7672b5bad645fd41786ce27`). No version bump was needed — `.14` had not been consumed yet, so the corrected metadata was folded into the in-flight `.14` jars as usual.

### Project

- **Fix: the Forge 1.20.1 loading screen reported "File … failed to load a valid ResourcePackInfo".** Symptom: the consumer's `run/1.20.1` client stopped on Forge's `Warning while loading mods` screen with one warning pointing at the library jar (both the user's screenshot and `latest.log` name `starengine_lib-forge-1.20.1-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.5.jar`; `.6` lacks the same file, so the warning is independent of the snapshot number), matching the log line `[net.minecraft.server.packs.repository.Pack/]: Missing metadata in pack mod:starengine_lib`. Root cause (read from the local Forge 1.20.1 sources, not guessed): `net.minecraftforge.client.loading.ClientModLoader#clientPackFinder` (lines 154-165) calls `Pack.readMetaAndCreate(name, …, PackType.CLIENT_RESOURCES, Pack.Position.BOTTOM, …)` for **every** mod file and, when it returns `null`, runs `ModLoader.get().addWarning(new ModLoadingWarning(mod, ModLoadingStage.ERROR, "fml.modloading.brokenresources", e.getKey()))` — that key resolves to `File {2} failed to load a valid ResourcePackInfo` in `assets/forge/lang/*.json`; `Pack.readMetaAndCreate` returns null when the jar has **no `pack.mcmeta`** (or its metadata cannot be parsed for that PackType). The server path is identical: `net.minecraftforge.server.ServerLifecycleHooks` (line 214) performs the same check for `PackType.SERVER_DATA`. ⇒ Any Forge 1.20.1 mod jar without `pack.mcmeta` produces one warning, and its resource pack is **not registered** (the library ships no resources today, so there is no functional loss — but it is a silent-failure surface). Fix: added `forge-1.20.1/src/main/resources/pack.mcmeta` (`pack_format` **15**, `description` = `starengine_lib resources`, same shape as the consumer's `forge-1.20.1/src/main/resources/pack.mcmeta`). **Scope: Forge 1.20.1 only** — NeoForge 1.21.1 / 26.1.2 never run those code paths (no such warning in their run logs, and the consumer's three jars only carry `pack.mcmeta` on 1.20.1), and `pack_format` differs per MC version, so the other platforms' values are **not guessed** (derive them from each version's client sources if ever needed). All three platforms' `lib_version` / `mod_version` were unified from `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.6` to **`1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.10`** (suffixes `+neoforge_1.21.1` / `+forge_1.20.1` / `+neoforge_26.1.2`, same patch segment as the consumer's `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.10`) and were republished with `publishToMavenLocal`; **no Java source changed**.
- **New config-driven constant `ALLOW_FIREARM_DAMAGE` (default `false`), carrying the consumer's public `allow_firearm_damage` option.** `component/GameplayConstants` gains a **non-final** `public static boolean ALLOW_FIREARM_DAMAGE = false` (the default **still blocks** firearm/artillery damage, exactly matching the existing behaviour; only when the option is `true` may such damage count towards spell damage), placed with the existing group of "still configurable" booleans (right after `EVENT_APPLY_OPAC`); `component/GameplayConfigValues` **appends** a 7th component `boolean allowFirearmDamage` at the end (the first six keep their names and order **verbatim**, so consumers still construct it positionally — a **source-compatible** addition); and `applyConfig(GameplayConfigValues)` writes the value inside its "only the few still-configurable fields" block, leaving the fixed-constant tick derivation untouched. The library still **reads no config file and holds no config schema** — the config file and option definitions stay on the consumer side as before. All three platforms' `lib_version` / `mod_version` move from `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.11` to **`1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.12`** (suffixes `+neoforge_1.21.1` / `+forge_1.20.1` / `+neoforge_26.1.2`); the bump is mandatory for the same reason as before: the version does not end in `-SNAPSHOT` (a normal version under Maven semantics), so Gradle does not treat it as a changing module — without a bump a consumer keeps resolving the old jar from `mavenLocal`, which has neither this constant nor the 7th record component, and fails to compile when it builds the snapshot.

## 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.6

> Convention: later edits to an entry already recorded for this version are merged into that entry — only the final version is kept, no "updated again" follow-ups.
> Note on the version number: `.6` is the **loader-gate fix** release — it fixes the root cause of the library itself being rejected by FML and aligns the Forge-side gate with the documented convention. The bump is mandatory for the same reason as before: the version does not end in `-SNAPSHOT` (a normal version under Maven semantics), so Gradle does not treat it as a changing module — without a bump a consumer keeps resolving the `.5` jar from `mavenLocal`, which carries the broken `loaderVersion` and is rejected by FML.

### Project

- **Fix: the library itself was rejected by FML (`loaderVersion` wrongly set to a NeoForge version band).** Symptom: two consecutive launches crashed in the FML phase on the consumer's `run/1.21.1` (`crash-2026-09-17_20.41.28-fml.txt` / `…_20.42.17-fml.txt`) with `Mod File …\starengine_lib-neoforge-1.21.1-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.5.jar needs language provider javafml:21.1 or above, and below 21.2 to load / We have found 4.0.42`, after which the consumer `astral_dice` was reported as `requires starengine_lib 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.5 or above … Currently, starengine_lib is not installed`. Root cause: `neoforge-1.21.1/gradle.properties` set `loader_version_range` to the **NeoForge version band** `[21.1,21.2)`, while the template's `neoforge.mods.toml:2 loaderVersion="${loader_version_range}"` compares against the **javafml language provider version** (NeoForge 21.1.235 reports `4.0.42`). Fix: the property is now the language range **`[1,)`** — the same value as the consumer's `astral_dice_multiloader-next/neoforge-1.21.1/gradle.properties:23`; the NeoForge band `[21.1,21.2)` still lives on the template's `modId="neoforge"` dependency (**unchanged**). The `neoforge-26.1.2` module already used `[1,)` (no rejection there) and keeps that value.
- **Same batch: Forge 1.20.1 gate aligned with the documented convention + version sync across all three platforms.** `loaderVersion` narrowed from `[47,)` to **`[47,48)`** (the javafml language provider version *is* the Forge major series `47`; a full-version range there makes FML fail with `fml.language.missingversion`), and the `modId="forge"` dependency now uses the exact range **`[47.4.10,48)`** derived in `build.gradle` from `forge_version` (the template placeholder changed from `${loader_version_range}` to `${forge_version_range}`), matching the consumer's `forge-1.20.1/build.gradle:139-152` convention line by line. All three platforms' `lib_version` / `mod_version` moved from `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.5` to **`1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.6`** (suffixes `+neoforge_1.21.1` / `+forge_1.20.1` / `+neoforge_26.1.2`) and were published with `publishToMavenLocal` (`~/.m2/repository/com/merlinkitsune/starenginelib/<artifact>/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.6/`); opening the jars asserts `loaderVersion` = `[1,)` / `[47,48)` / `[1,)` and the Forge dependency `versionRange="[47.4.10,48)"`, with the `neoforge` / `minecraft` ranges unchanged. **No Java source in the library was touched** (metadata, template comments and docs only); consumer pins and the CI ref are synced on the consumer side and are out of scope here.

## 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.5

> Note on the version number: `.5` is the **merge-cleanup** release — the mainline (`multi-1.20.1-1.21.1` @ `8f68482`) has been merged into the consumer's `multi-dev-next`, so the library now deletes the "delete once merged" transition symbols on schedule. The bump is mandatory for the same reason as `.4`: the version does not end in `-SNAPSHOT` (a normal version under Maven semantics), so Gradle does not treat it as a changing module — without a bump a consumer keeps resolving the stale `.4` jar from `mavenLocal`.

### Project

- **Transition symbols deleted on schedule (the deleted part).** Before deleting anything, every symbol was proven to have **zero references** across the three merged consumer lines (`neoforge-1.21.1` / `forge-1.20.1` / `neoforge-26.1.2`) by grep, and then removed: (1) `EventTargetCollector`'s `collectTargets` / `collectTeamTargets` / `collectMaids` / `isMaidOwnedBy` (together with the `GameplayConstants.EVENT_RANGE` / `EVENT_APPLY_MAID` branch they used); (2) `GameplayConstants.KOMACHI_EXTRA_PLAYS_CAP`; (3) `effect/ReadyEffect` (sunk in `.4`, zero references after the merge). Decision notes: all 6 `collectTargets` grep hits belong to the consumer's **own** `RandomCardHandler.collectTargets` (a different class and signature), so the library method really is unreferenced; `EVENT_APPLY_MC_TEAM` / `EVENT_APPLY_FTB_TEAM` / `EVENT_APPLY_OPAC` and `EventTargetCollector.collectTeamPlayers` are **live** (called from several consumer sites) and were kept verbatim. Commands and raw output: `temp/t5-cleanup-notes-20260917.md`.
- **Transition symbols deleted on schedule (completed in the same batch) — the event-framework triad.** The three files `event/AstralEventType` / `EventContext` / `EventEffect` were removed together (they reference each other: `AstralEventType(ResourceLocation, EventEffect)`, `EventEffect.apply(EventContext)`, `AstralEventType.trigger(EventContext)` — they must go as one), and the `sourceSets.main.java.exclude` line that `neoforge-26.1.2/build.gradle` kept for `AstralEventType` was removed with them (with the file gone the line could only be dead residue). **Precondition:** the merged consumer's `event/AstralEventSystem.java` had left 4 library `import`s in its import block (unused by the body, but an unresolved `import` is itself a compile error), so the consumer-side commit `7dc64cb` had to remove them first; after that, `git grep -E 'AstralEventType|EventContext|EventEffect' -- '*.java'` reports **0 hits** across the consumer's three lines. ⚠️ Because that precondition was only met after `.5` had already been published once, the `.5` bytes were **republished** (same version number, different bytes) — consumers must re-resolve with `--refresh-dependencies` (or clear the mavenLocal cache), otherwise they keep the old `.5` bytes that still carry the triad.
- **Version and consumer sync.** Library version `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.4 → 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.5` (all three platform `gradle.properties` share the number); the dev-next `starengine_lib_version` and `starengine_lib_version_range` on both sides (expanded from `${starengine_lib_version_range}` in the two `mods.toml` files) now read `[1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.5,2.0)`; and the consumer CI's pinned library checkout `ref` was moved to the library commit that carries `.5` **after** the triad removal, with a comment stating that "a library version bump must update this ref in the same commit". ⚠️ The library repository has **not been pushed** yet, so that sha exists only locally and a CI checkout will fail until the repository is pushed and the sha is reachable.

## 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.4

> Convention: later edits to an entry already recorded for this version are merged into that entry — only the final version is kept, no "updated again" follow-ups.
> Note on the version number: `.4` **continues** `.3` rather than redoing it — the library only **adds** `common/effect/ReadyEffect`. The bump is mandatory for the same reason as `.3`: the version does not end in `-SNAPSHOT` (a normal version under Maven semantics), so Gradle does not treat it as a changing module — without a bump a consumer keeps resolving the stale `.3` jar from `mavenLocal` and then fails to compile with "cannot find symbol" for the missing class. The `.3` entries are kept unchanged in the next section.

### New Content

- **`effect/ReadyEffect` was sunk into the library.** The class exists in all three lines (`neoforge-1.21.1` / `forge-1.20.1` / `neoforge-26.1.2`) with **byte-identical** content and imports only vanilla `MobEffect` / `MobEffectCategory` — no consumer-specific class — making it the **only** one of the 53 candidates selected by the "identical across all three lines + self-contained" rule that was not yet in the library (the other 52 were either already sunk in earlier phases or excluded with a recorded reason, see Project). It now lives at `common/src/main/java/com/merlinkitsune/starenginelib/effect/ReadyEffect.java` (14 lines / 540 bytes), byte-for-byte the original with only the `package` line rewritten to the library package, line endings (CRLF) preserved.

### Project

- **The sink criteria for three-line shared classes are now recorded** (manifest: `temp/sink-manifest-20260917.md`). Candidate gate = "the same relative java file has an identical SHA-256 on all three lines" (229 java files across the three lines → 53 candidates); self-containment gate = "the reference closure stays inside the candidate set ∪ classes already in the library ∪ Minecraft/loader APIs". Every exclusion is listed with its reason: not identical across the three lines (176), depends on a consumer-specific class (`ModItems`, `ModAttachments`, `BaseChipItem`, `DiceCombatModifiers`, `SpellDamageRegistry`, …), or one of the 3 mixins (`mixin/trade/Merchant{Container,Menu,ResultSlot}Mixin`, which need a mixin config and a refmap the library has no infrastructure for).
- **Pre-merge drift audit (the reason these classes were left untouched).** For every copy that dev-next had deleted and the mainline had later modified, the library counterpart was compared line by line: `component/GameplayConstants` already **carries the mainline constant values** (`MAX_MARKER` 16→32, `HAND_FAN_BIG_RANGE` made `final`, `MAX_STARLIGHT` / `EFFECT_CARD_COOLDOWN_SECONDS` / `MAX_EFFECT_STACKS` made `final`, …), and the only remaining differences are the deliberate "value-snapshot seam vs `ModCommonConfig`" split plus the transition symbols kept by prior convention (`EVENT_RANGE` / `EVENT_APPLY_MAID` / `KOMACHI_EXTRA_PLAYS_CAP` / `TARGET_SELECT_RADIUS`); `event/EventTargetCollector` keeps its **full implementation** in the library (the pre-merge consumer still calls `collectTargets(...)`); and the differences in `item/BossEntityUtil`, `event/SignActiveTriggeredEvent`, `event/ModEffectRemoval` and `client/ActionBarManager` (one copy per platform) are shim base classes and comments only. ⇒ None of the mainline's changes in this set can be lost by the merge.
- **Two leftover consumer-package references in `common` were removed.** The javadoc of `effect/HealingEffect` and `event/AmethystDiceHandler` still carried `{@link com.merlinkitsune.astral_dice.item.HealingManager}` and `{@link com.merlinkitsune.astral_dice.combat.SpellDamageRegistry}` — the earlier package rename only rewrote the `starengine` segment, so the consumer package survived verbatim; it never broke the build, but it violated the acceptance rule "`common` must contain no reference to a consumer-specific class". Both are now plain text, with zero change to behaviour or signatures; after the cleanup the library (including all three platform subprojects) references `com.merlinkitsune.astral_dice` **0** times.
- **Consumers must raise their range lower bound to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.4`.** Both `gradle.properties` files in the dev-next worktree now carry the new `starengine_lib_version` / `starengine_lib_version_range`, and both `mods.toml` files expand to the same range through `${starengine_lib_version_range}`. The semantics are the same "exact lower bound" as `.3`: `[1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.4,2.0)` rejects `.1` / `.2` / `.3`, accepts `.4` / `.10` / `1.0.0` / `1.1.0`, and still rejects `2.0.0`.

## 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.3

> Convention: later edits to an entry already recorded for this version are merged into that entry — only the final version is kept, no "updated again" follow-ups.
> Note on the version number: the library was previously built locally as `1.1.0` (never published anywhere outside `mavenLocal`) and was renumbered to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.1` for its first public release. It then became **`1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.2`**, because the Java package was renamed while `mod_version` stayed `1.0.0` — the patch segment alone carries the rename, so a dependency range can tell the two jars apart. It is now **`1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.3`**, because Cloth Config and the in-library config module were removed entirely, `GameplayConfigValues` was narrowed from 13 fields to 6 and the dead event-framework classes were deleted — again binary-incompatible, so it needs its own patch segment before a consumer can stop resolving the stale `.2` jar from `mavenLocal`. Since `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.1` and `.2` never reached any repository other than `mavenLocal`, all three versions' entries are merged here as one `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.3` changelog.

### Breaking Changes

- **Java package renamed `com.merlinkitsune.starengine` → `com.merlinkitsune.starenginelib`; the Maven `groupId` moved with it.** The package segment `starengine` was replaced by `starenginelib` at every place it is a *package*: `package` / `import` statements, javadoc `{@link}` targets, the three source directories (`common`, `neoforge-1.21.1`, `forge-1.20.1`) and `mod_group_id` in both `gradle.properties` — 50 files, 69 occurrences, plus the publication `groupId` (`com.merlinkitsune.starengine` → `com.merlinkitsune.starenginelib`). Deliberately **unchanged**: the mod id `starengine_lib`, the display name `StarEngine Lib`, every `StarEngine*` class name, and all historical records (older `CHANGELOG` entries, `docs/starengine-lib/`, the one-off `tools/migrate_to_starengine_lib.py`). The rename is **binary-incompatible at the same version number** — the pre-rename `.1` jar and this `.2` jar expose identical `modId` and identical MC-version suffixes but different class names — so consumers must move their range lower bound too (see Project below). Replacement was literal and byte-level (`starengine(?![A-Za-z0-9_])`, case-sensitive), so `starengine_lib` (mod id), `starenginelib` (new package) and `StarEngine` (brand/class prefix) could never be hit; line endings were preserved, so the diff is exactly one line per occurrence and contains no CRLF/LF noise. Verified after the rename by opening both platform jars: 45 (neoforge) / 47 (forge) classes, **0 occurrences** of the old package in class paths or the constant pool, and a full byte scan of the repository (binaries included) likewise finds 0 real references. Any consumer artifact that pairs the library's fully-qualified class names with a *string* (a Mixin config targeting `com.merlinkitsune.starengine.*`, an obfuscation mapping, reflection or codegen) had to be updated as well; this repository has none left. Client-visible impact: none.

### New Content

- First extraction of **StarEngine Lib** (`starengine_lib`) from the Astral Dice 1.20.1 / 1.21.1 multiloader monorepo: 34 shared units that both MC versions can reference (18 `MobEffect` implementations, the `AstralEventType`/`EventContext`/`EventEffect`/`EventTargetCollector` event framework, the target-selection framework, `BossEntityUtil`, `ClientDamageNumbers`, `GameplayConstants`, `SignActiveTriggeredEvent`, `AmethystDiceHandler`) were moved down into this library to be reused by the upcoming **Astral Dice Extra** mod and its siblings.
- The library registers **no** registry entries (items / effects / attachments / data components / capabilities all remain in the consuming mod). Introducing or upgrading the library therefore changes no `ResourceLocation` ownership, so it can neither corrupt saves nor break datapacks.
- Provides a **platform-neutral config seam**: `GameplayConfigValues` (a plain snapshot record) and `GameplayConstants.applyConfig(...)`. Config files and config IO **do not** move into the library — `ModConfigSpec` (NeoForge) and `ForgeConfigSpec` (Forge) are not interchangeable, so the option definitions, the TOML IO and the config screen all stay in the consuming mod, while the library only declares which gameplay values are configurable and how they are applied. A consumer builds the snapshot in its own config load/reload callback and pushes it; **a config change needs no restart** (`GameplayConstants` fields are non-final runtime reads).

- Added the **`neoforge-26.1.2` platform**: the library goes from "two versions share one source" to "**three versions share one source**" — the same `common` sources are now compiled by Java 17 (forge-1.20.1), Java 21 (neoforge-1.21.1) and Java 25 (neoforge-26.1.2; MC 26.1.2 / NeoForge 26.1.2.109 / ModDevGradle 2.0.147 / **no Parchment**, since Parchment's official maven 404s for every 26.1.x / 26.2 build), one jar per platform, all sharing one version number.
### Project

- **Multiloader single-repo shape.** `common/src/main/java` is a shared *source directory* (not a Gradle subproject); the `neoforge-1.21.1` (Java 21, Mojmap + Parchment, ModDevGradle 2.0.141) and `forge-1.20.1` (Java 17, reobf SRG, ModDevGradle Legacy 2.0.144) subprojects each add it as an extra `sourceSet` and compile the same sources once, producing one jar per MC version.
- **Two hard constraints on shared sources**, both enforced at compile time rather than by convention: `common` may not use Java 21-only syntax (record patterns, switch patterns, `SequencedCollection`, …) — enforced by the Java 17 toolchain compiling the same sources — and may only use MC APIs that exist with **identical signatures** in both versions.
- **Loader divergence lives in the platform subprojects**, one file per side: `ActionBarManager` (`DeltaTracker` vs `float partialTick`), `ModEffectRemoval` (`Holder<MobEffect>` vs `MobEffect`), the custom data key (`DataComponent` vs Forge's `ItemDataKey`), and the Curios integration (`CuriosCompat`, Forge only).
- **Loader divergence folded into shims.** `platform/LoaderEvent` is an abstract base that each side extends from its own event bus type (NeoForge / Forge), and `platform/LoaderTags` exposes the `c:bosses` common tag from the platform's own `Tags` class. Shared files such as `SignActiveTriggeredEvent` and `BossEntityUtil` reference only the shims, so no `net.neoforged.*` / `net.minecraftforge.*` literal remains in shared code.
- **Config stays out of the library (a value-snapshot seam).** `ModConfigSpec` (NeoForge) and `ForgeConfigSpec` (Forge) are not interchangeable, and config IO plus the config GUI can only be done per platform, so the library holds **no config schema, reads no config file and ships no config screen**; it keeps only the platform-neutral `GameplayConfigValues` (a plain snapshot record) and `GameplayConstants.applyConfig(...)`. A consumer registers its own config and pushes the current values as a snapshot; changes take effect without a restart. The record's fields are the contract — consumers construct it **positionally**, so adding, removing or reordering a field breaks them at **compile time** (exactly why a record was chosen over a loose set of getters). As a result `common` contains no loader literals and no third-party config library dependency, and the library's only required prerequisites are the loader itself (plus Curios on the Forge side).
- **The version was bumped to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.3` (mandatory).** This change deletes the in-library config module and the event-framework classes and narrows `GameplayConfigValues`, all binary-incompatible; because the version does not end in `-SNAPSHOT` (a normal version under Maven semantics), Gradle does not treat it as a changing module — without a bump a consumer keeps resolving the stale `.2` jar from `mavenLocal` and then fails to compile with "cannot find symbol".
- **Maven publication.** NeoForge publishes `from components.java` (a plain Mojmap jar — NeoForge compiles and ships Mojmap from 1.20.5 on, so no remapping is needed); Forge 1.20.1 publishes `reobfJar`, i.e. the **production SRG jar**, because the consuming MDG LegacyForge remaps SRG jars to dev Mojmap names at resolution time. Publishing the non-reobfuscated dev jar instead would cause `NoSuchFieldError` in production. Both publications set an explicit `artifactId` so the coordinates match `archivesName`.
- **Consumers must raise their range lower bound to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.3`.** Adjacent snapshots are **binary-incompatible** (`.1` → `.2` renamed the package; `.2` → `.3` removed the in-library config module, narrowed `GameplayConfigValues` and deleted the event-framework classes), while the older jars share the `modId` and the version *shape*, differing only in patch segment — so a loose range such as `[1.0.0-SNAPSHOT,2.0)` matches them too: a stale `.1` fails at runtime with `NoClassDefFoundError: com/merlinkitsune/starengine/...`, and a stale `.2` fails at compile time because classes such as `StarEngineConfigs` no longer exist. `[1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.3,2.0)` rejects `.1` / `.2` while accepting `.3` / `.10` / `1.0.0` / `1.1.0`, and still rejects `2.0.0`. Measured against `maven-artifact` 3.8.5 across three ranges × seven versions (`[1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.2,2.0)` rejects `.1`, accepts `.2`/`.3`/`.10`/`1.0.0`/`1.1.0` and rejects `2.0.0`; all three are "exact lower bound" semantics, so moving the bound to `.3` behaves identically); note `.10` compares **numerically** (not lexicographically), so a two-digit patch segment does not fall out of range.
- **Auto-deploy on build.** `pushToPack` copies the library jar into both modpack `mods` directories after `build` (the SRG jar into the Forge test pack, the plain jar into the NeoForge pack), matching the consumer's existing "build means deploy" convention. This step is not optional: the consumer declares `starengine_lib` as a required dependency, so a missing library jar makes the pack refuse to start. ⚠️ **Since 2026-09-12 this stops on development branches — `main` is exempt.** The library and the consumer must enter a pack as a **matched pair** (the consumer pins the library version at compile time *and* declares a range in `mods.toml`), so as soon as one side advances alone the pack holds an unmatched combination and dies at startup with `NoClassDefFoundError` or "missing required prerequisite". The consumer already stopped pushing on its development branch `multi-dev-next`, so this library stops in lockstep on `main`, freezing the packs on the last matched pair instead of letting one side overwrite them. The guard reads the current git branch from `.git/HEAD` at **execution time** (configuration-cache friendly; a branch switch takes effect immediately) and handles both layouts — a normal repository's `.git` directory and a worktree's `.git` *file* holding `gitdir: <path>`; an undeterminable branch (detached HEAD, no `.git`, i.e. CI) is skipped as well, which is the safe side. `-PdeployToPack` / `-PpackPush` still forces a push for manual releases — when you use it, push the consumer jar as well so the pair stays matched.
- **Hosted on GitHub with its own CI and releases.** The repository now lives at <https://github.com/merlin-kitsune/starengine_lib> and carries `.github/workflows/build.yml`, following the Astral Dice release convention: every push / PR / manual run builds both targets with JDK 21 + JDK 17 and uploads a `starengine_lib-jars` artifact; a push to `main` auto-creates the tag (tag = base version, no `v` prefix, no `+loader` suffix); a tag push creates or updates a GitHub Release whose assets are both platform jars. One guard was added on top of the consumer's rule — **a version containing `-` (a snapshot) is not auto-tagged**, otherwise `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.1` would be truncated to `1.0.0` and silently published as a release tag. The `gradlew` executable bit was also restored in the git index (`100644` → `100755`): committed from Windows, the repository shipped a non-executable wrapper, so `./gradlew` on the runner died with `Permission denied` (exit 126) before Gradle ever started. Because the consumer's CI checks this repository out first, that single defect reddened **both** repositories' Actions.
- **The library version range must start at `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`, not `1.0`.** Under Maven `ComparableVersion` semantics `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.1 < 1.0`, so a consumer declaring `versionRange="[1.0,2.0)"` would reject every `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.x` build and refuse to start. Verified empirically against `maven-artifact` 3.8.5 — both loaders route through `MavenVersionAdapter.createFromVersionSpec` → `VersionRange.createFromVersionSpec`: `[1.0,2.0)` excludes `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.1`, while `[1.0.0-SNAPSHOT,2.0)` includes it together with `1.0.0` / `1.1.0`. The bound then has to be precise down to the snapshot index (currently `.2`, see the next entry), otherwise it is too loose to protect against an older jar at the same coordinate.
- **The consumer's CI now builds the library first.** Because the library is published only to `mavenLocal`, Astral Dice's `build.yml` checks out this repository and runs `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` before building itself. The two repositories' versions must therefore stay in lockstep (consumer's `starengine_lib_version` ↔ this library's `lib_version`), or the consumer CI fails at dependency resolution.
- **Two 26.1 platform differences were sunk into shims.** (1) The identifier class was renamed `net.minecraft.resources.ResourceLocation` → `Identifier` (1.20.1 / 1.21.1 still use the old name). (2) `EntityType#is(TagKey)` is gone and must go through `builtInRegistryHolder()`. (2) is absorbed by `platform/LoaderTags#isBoss(Entity)`, so the shared `BossEntityUtil` is unaware of the difference, and the 26.1.2 `LoaderTags` builds `c:bosses` with `TagKey.create` instead of a platform Tags constant that drifts between versions. (1) has no type-alias equivalent in Java, so the only file using the old name, `common/event/AstralEventType`, is `sourceSets.main.java.exclude`d from the 26.1.2 compile (it and its siblings are already gone from the consumer's mainline; the library only keeps them for now).
